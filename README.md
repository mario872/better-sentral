# better-sentral
Sentral has been updated, and I don't particularly like the look of it, so I'm going to try and make it look nicer.

Bugs to Squash:
 - [ ] Javascript Not Enabled in Sentralify?
 - [ ] Fetching timetable sometimes creates TimeoutError in Sentralify, how to deal with that here?
 - [ ] Make text in notices black

Soon to be features:
 - [ ] Add junk / news section
 - [ ] Add random fake news article about apples each day in 'junk' section
 - [ ] Add daily weather
 - [ ] Add Sentralify logo to tab
 - [x] See your timetable
 - [x] See daily notices
 - [ ] See attendance
 - [ ] See activities
 - [ ] See awards
 - [x] Use Encryption to store passwords (see, I thought about this!)

Long term features:
 - [ ] Reminders on the webpage
 - [ ] A recurring list of items you need each lesson on the webpage
 - [ ] Be able to upload your own profile photo
