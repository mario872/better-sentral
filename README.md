# better-sentral
Sentral has been updated, and I hate it. It looks bad, and horrible, so I'm just going to make my own webpage.

Soon to be features:
 - [ ] See your timetable
 - [ ] See daily notices
 - [ ] See attendance
 - [ ] See activities
 - [ ] See awards
 - [ ] Use Encryption to store passwords (see, I thought about this!)

Long term features:
 - [ ] Reminders on the webpage
 - [ ] A recurring list of items you need each lesson on the webpage

### What am I working on right now?
Getting the Flask (I have no idea how to use Django) web server to run the basic website
