# better-sentral
Sentral has been updated, and I hate it. It looks bad, and horrible, so I'm just going to make my own webpage.

Soon to be features:
 - [x] See your timetable
 - [x] See daily notices
 - [ ] See attendance
 - [ ] See activities
 - [ ] See awards
 - [x] Use Encryption to store passwords (see, I thought about this!)

Long term features:
 - [ ] Reminders on the webpage
 - [ ] A recurring list of items you need each lesson on the webpage
 - [ ] Be able to upload your own profile photo

### What am I working on right now?
